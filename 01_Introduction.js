Introduction to JavaScript

- JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language.
- It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 for web development.
- JavaScript is primarily used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.
- It runs in the browser, but can also be used on the server (Node.js).
- JavaScript follows the ECMAScript standard (currently ES6 and above).
- It is a versatile language: supports object-oriented, functional, and event-driven programming.
- JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS.

Key Features:
1. Lightweight and easy to learn.
2. Dynamically typed language.
3. Supports asynchronous programming (callbacks, promises, async/await).
4. Can manipulate HTML and CSS (DOM manipulation).
5. Large ecosystem and community support.

Example:
console.log("Hello, JavaScript!");
